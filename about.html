    <h4 class="display-4">How does it work?</h4>
    <p>There's not much fancy going on under the hood: We look at all the artists in your playlists, lookup their
      albums,
      then add them to a new playlist if they fresh enough!</p>
    <h4 class="display-4">What are you doing with my account?</h4>
    <p>Not much; we use the bare minumum permissions needed to read your playlists (both public and private) and to
      create a new playlist (both public and private).</p>
    <h4 class="display-4">Who are you and why should I trust you?</h4>
    <p>I'm a software engineer that takes great pleasure from making things for others. My projects are free to use with
      no ads; they're purely for your enjoyment! I also keep my code open source for all other to view, so there's no
      secret behind these curtains!</p>
